# Tamagui Web App

A minimal Vite + Tamagui demo site.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (or the version in `.nvmrc` if present)
- pnpm (recommended) — install with `npm i -g pnpm` if needed

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2. Update basic metadata (optional but recommended):
   - Edit `package.json` → `name` to your project name.
   - Edit `index.html` → `<head>` → `<title>` to set the page title.

## Development

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the address the dev server prints) in your browser.

## Build & Preview

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Purpose

This repository is a minimal example of using Tamagui with Vite for web projects. Use it as a starting point for building UI with Tamagui components and theming.
